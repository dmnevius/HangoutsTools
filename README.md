  - ___Basic___ - The basic depth will create the smallest size file and will contain general information, as well as detailed information about individual hangouts. This information will include the members, their post counts, and a time-line of posts.
  - ___Advanced___ - The advanced depth will contain everything from the basic depth, as well as more interesting data such as the amount of spam, who most often replies  to eachother, and more.
  - ___Extreme___ - Extreme is the same as advanced, except that it includes information about word usage. You will be able to search for words to see how many times they have been said in total and by every memeber of your hangouts. You will also have a timeline of that word's usage. This file size is considerably bigger than the others.
